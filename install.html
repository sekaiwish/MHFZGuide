      <h1>Installation Guide</h1>
      <h2 id="1">Preparation</h2>
      <p>As the game is no longer in service, you must download the entire game as a 6GB archive through the links in the following section. You should decide now whether you want
      to join a public server or host your own. The advantage of the latter being that you are able to control your savefile and edit certain server parameters, the disadvantage being that you
      are solely responsible for any issues that occur. If you choose to join a public server, then you may skip the server installation guide after completing the client installation.</p>
      <p>This guide will only cover installation on Windows 10+ computers, installation is possible on all types of computers but require much more effort. Feel free to ask us on Discord
      for advice on installing on such systems.</p>
      <h2 id="2">Downloading</h2>
      <p>The client is available for download on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SJKWSPGlvUt795YSVePfDDxybwD9yRsz/view">Google Drive</a> or
      <a href="https://1fichier.com/?pbja1soxfajj72gj96v0">1fichier</a>.</p>
      <p>The server (Erupe) is included with the client download, and has server updates 1 though 5 already installed.</p>
      <p>Updates to both the client and the server will be available for download <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ejhsua309mBXbVeCL8oAZNE2NdbUPEpe">here</a>. Check
      in often for the lastest updates, or join our <a href="#">Discord</a> for notifications when these updates are released!</p>
      <h2 id="3">Installing the client</h2>
      <h3>MHFZ</h3>
      <p>Before doing anything, open Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Virus & threat protection settings > Add or remove exclusions, and add the folder where you are
      planning to install MHFZ to. This is to prevent Windows from deleting your game when it is a false-positive. Now, go back to Virus & threat protection settings and temporarily disable
      Real-time protection. This is because when you extract the client from the zip, Windows will temporarily store it somewhere you cannot exclude and it will be flagged as a false-positive
      there instead.</p>
      <p>Now, go ahead and extract the client files into the destination folder. Once the process is complete, you can enable Real-time protection again.</p>
      <p>If mhf.exe is not in the folder after doing this, Windows has deleted your client and you will have to try again.</p>
      <h3>Hosts</h3>
      <p>You will have to edit your hosts file, located in <span>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\</span>. Since the file is in a protected location you will have to use a program like Notepad++
      to edit it. Alternatively, copy the file somewhere else such as your Desktop, edit it there and then copy it back and overwrite the protected one.</p>
      <p>For self-hosting you would add the following line at the bottom of the file;</p>
      <p><span>127.0.0.1 cog-members.mhf-z.jp www.capcom-onlinegames.jp srv-mhf.capcom-networks.jp</span></p>
      <p>If connecting to a public server, you will have to replace the IP address with one that the host will provide you.</p>
      <h3>Locale Emulator</h3>
      <p>To avoid unreadable text appearing in the game, it is recommended to use <a href="https://github.com/xupefei/Locale-Emulator/releases/latest">Locale Emulator</a>. Just extract the
      zip archive somewhere, probably a new folder in Program Files, and run LEInstaller.exe to have it available for MHFZ.</p>
      <p>When you want to launch the game, right click mhf.exe and click Locale Emulator > Run in Japanese.</p>
      <p>If you want to automatically launch the game with LE every time, right click mhf.exe > Create shortcut, right click the new shortcut and open
      Properties. Change the Target the following, adjusting to your own setup;</p><p><span>"C:\[Path to LE]\LEProc.exe" "C:\[Path to MHFZ]\mhf.exe"</span></p>
      <h3>Google Lens</h3>
      <p>If you come across certain screens that you would like to read, install Google Translate on your phone and use the camera option to automatically translate any text in the game.</p>
      <h2 id="4">Installing the server</h2>
      <h3>Preface</h3>
      <p>It is highly recommended to use SephVII's <a href="https://youtu.be/e5wyOJ_R1go?t=433">video guide</a> for this process as it is very technical and it is easy to get confused.</p>
      <h3>Go Programming Language</h3>
      <p>Download Go from the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install">official website</a> and install it.</p>
      <h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
      <p>Download PostgreSQL from <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads">EnterpriseDB</a>, using the Windows x86-64 build. Please do not install
      PostgreSQL on a drive other than the default, this is known to cause issues. Please remember both passwords! Also, you do not need Stack Builder.</p>
      <p>Included with the MHFZ server files should be Erupe-Backup.sql and Road Shop Items.csv, extract these into a folder somewhere. PostgreSQL comes with a convienient client called
      pgAdmin, search for it in Windows and open it. Enter your Master Password from earlier to unlock pgAdmin. First, go to File > Preferences > Binary paths and scroll down to PostgreSQL 14.
      Click the three dots and locate your PostgreSQL bin folder which should be at <span>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin</span>.</p>
      <p>In pgAdmin, under Servers you should have a default called PostgreSQL 14, right click that and click Create > Database, name it <span>erupe</span>. Right click the newly created database
      and click Restore, click the folder icon next to Filename and select your Erupe-Backup.sql then click Restore.</p>
      <p>Now, expand Databases > erupe > Schemas > public > Tables, right click normal_shop_items > Import/Export data, switch it to Import mode. Click the three dots next to Filename and select
      your Road Shop Items.csv, then press OK.</p>
      <h3>Erupe</h3>
      <p>First, extract your Erupe folder from the download somewhere. In the Erupe folder, if you do not see a savedata folder, create it. Now open Quests.7z which should be included with the
      archive, and extract the bin folder into the Erupe folder, this will probably take a long time.</p>
      <p>Open the config.json file in Erupe, ensure your host_ip is set correctly. This will be your external IP if you are hosting for others, 127.0.0.1 if you are self-hosting. Scroll down to
      Entries and you will see more IP address fields, make sure these are all set to the same address as host_ip. Go back up to the Database section and set the password from before.</p>
      <p>You should now be able to open Run Erupe.bat, wait a minute or so for the program to build and download required libraries and it should be good to go.</p>
      <h2 id="5">Updating the server</h2>
      <h3>Preface</h3>
      <p>This process will have different requirements per update, this is a general overview of common actions made to update your server.</p>
      <h3>Updating your database schema / Using the pgAdmin Query Tool</h3>
      <p>Open pgAdmin, expand Servers > PostgreSQL > Databases and click on erupe. Now click Tools > Query Tool, updates will either contain required code in the Readme or will come with
      a Schema.sql file, extract the schema file and drag it into the Query Tool, then press Execute (F5).</p>
      <h3>Rebuilding Erupe.exe</h3>
      <p>Delete your old Erupe.exe to prevent issues overwriting, open CMD and use the CD command to browse to your Erupe directory, run the command <span>go build</span> to build a new Erupe.exe.</p>
